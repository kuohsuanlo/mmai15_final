NTU MMAI_15 Final

Idea : After watching a long series of tv shows, animantion, it is hard to recall a specific set of characters' interaction (Like Gandalf and Frodo in the Lord of the Ring).
So we would like to design a system that could extract all the interaction scence between these characters set.

System name : Animation Scence Highlighting through user chosen character sets.

0. Extracting Faces from animation shots.
1. Using unsupervised method to group them (Defined proper features)
2. Find a ideal representation shot for the group icon.
3. List all the characters appears in this specific animation(TV Series)
4. Let users pick their querying characters
5. Output all the shots that contains these characters (Or several near shots)
6. Output polishing (Text, comments, quotes...)
